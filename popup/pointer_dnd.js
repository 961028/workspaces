// ===== ADVANCED DRAG-AND-DROP WIDGET (EXPERIMENTAL) =====
/**
 * This section implements a pointer-based drag-and-drop reordering widget for list items.
 * It is modular and does not interfere with the existing drag-and-drop logic above.
 *
 * To use, add the 'js-list' class to a <ul> or <ol> and 'js-item' to its <li> children.
 *
 * All logic is self-contained and follows the project's coding standards.
